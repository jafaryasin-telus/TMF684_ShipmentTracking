# TMF684_ShipmentTracking
TM Forum Open APIs (Apache 2.0) Shipment Tracking API

Telco companies often send goods to customers. Shipment information can be provided to them so 
they can be aware of when things were shipped and when they will arrive. Typically telcos use 
different delivery companies to deliver things on their behalf and this API intends to 
abstract the end developers from that complexity by providing a single interface. A 
Shipment Tracking captures information about the current status of the shipment, the past 
checkpoints and the estimated arrival date. Via this API, tracking information can be retrieved 
by providing an order Id or the shipping companyâ€™s tracking id.
